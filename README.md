## ✍️ Your Blog
A gloriously simple HTML blog that screams "I’m learning web development and I’m *not* afraid to show it."

### 📦 What's in the box:
- A homepage
- Two fake blog posts
- Styling that won't blind anyone
- Navigation links to pages that definitely don’t exist yet

### 🚀 How to use
1. Open the `.html` file in your browser to preview your masterpiece.
2. Edit the blog posts inside the `<div class="post">` tags.
3. Brag about being a web developer now.

### 🌐 How to publish it
Choose your flavor of deployment:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (fast, free, nerdy)
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2. Make a new repo and upload your `.html` file(s)
3. Go to **Settings > Pages**
4. Select `main` as your branch, hit save
5. Wait a few seconds and get a free URL like:  
   `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

#### Option B: Netlify or Vercel (still free, but cooler fonts)
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Deploy with 1 click
4. Get a beautiful URL like `https://yoursite.netlify.app`

#### Option C: Real Hosting (aka you wanna spend money)
1. Buy a domain
2. Get hosting
3. Upload your files
4. Regret your financial decisions later

### 💡 Suggestions for future you
- Replace lorem ipsum with real angst
- Add a contact form no one will use
- Set up Google Analytics to track your 2 visitors
- Consider not turning it into a full-blown startup
